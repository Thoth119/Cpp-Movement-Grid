# Overview

For this little practice, I decided to push myself, utilizing vscode with C++ as I have only
attempted to use the language in vs community. 

I wrote out a clear and simple grid, that responds to the user inputing to move an 'X' or character
around on the provided grid. 

My purpose for writing this was to further my understanding of programing, but mainly to push
my understanding of video game code, and how to write something like 'movement' from scratch.

# Development Environment

I utilized msys2 for setting up the environment, with C/C++ Compile Run (by danielpinto8zz6) as all other compilers were failing. Setting up was a real pain, adding in the pathing to my pc and installing all the g++ and necessary tool kits. I wrote most of the code on my big bulky pc, but the environment geniunely wasn't identifying the bin/pathway probably due to the ludicrous amount of extensions I have, so I swapped to laptop.

# Future Work

Things to add:

- Item 1: Some sort of 'item' for the 'X' to collect in order to increase a highscore
- Item 2: Looping grid, similar to pac-man
- Item 3: remove the need to hit 'Enter' somehow...
